# Front End test for CDD

## Setup
- Run `npm install` within cloned directory, then `grunt`

## Problems
- Hamster blend mode is set to multiply on PSD. Unfortunately blend modes aren't supported in IE/Edge yet

## With more time
- Would have done a better job cutting out the Hamster(!), and also separated the shadow from the Hamster so that it could be animated separately (shrunk and faded when jumping)
