# Front End test for CDD

## Setup
- Run `npm install` within cloned directory, then `grunt`

## Problems
- Hamster blend mode is set to multiply on PSD. Unfortunately blend modes aren't supported in IE/Edge yet

## With more time
- Would have done a better job cutting out the Hamster, and also separated the shadow from the Hamster so that it could be animated separately (shrunk and faded when jumping)
- Done something with the circles on the last slide. Possibly the hamster jumping out of his circle, and into the frog's, followed by a green splat on the screen (don't judge me!).
- When the joke is run, would like to have the frogs mouth move to give the impression of speaking
